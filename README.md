# Preach

Preach is a pseudo programming language meant to look like excerpts from the Bible, or any holy text for that matter.

## File format

Preach programs are text files with the `.holy` extension.

## Terminology

* A program is a sermon.
* A function is a commandment.
* "God / The Lord / He" is used to call functions. Functions are fundamentally verbs.

A statement can begin with a flourish prefix such as :

```
Then
Now
And
In the beginning,  # will raise an error if found anywhere but at the first line
But
Thus
Soz
```
